# AI-Pacman-MultiAgent-Project
Project of the AI course including agent designing and "minimax", "expectimax" search in PacMan world
Q1: Improve the ReflexAgent in multiAgents.py to play respectably.
Q2: Write an adversarial search agent in the provided MinimaxAgent class stub in multiAgents.py. Your minimax agent should work with any number of ghosts.
Q3: Make a new agent that uses alpha-beta pruning to more efficiently explore the minimax tree, in AlphaBetaAgent.
Q4: Implement the ExpectimaxAgent, which is useful for modeling probabilistic behavior of agents who may make suboptimal choices.
Q5: Write a better evaluation function for Pacman in the provided function betterEvaluationFunction. The evaluation function should evaluate states, rather than actions like your reflex agent evaluation function did.
